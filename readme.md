_Prerequisite: run `yarn` to install all project dependencies._

Project is split into 2 parts:

1. Mock REST API, which is a fa√ßade remote data source.
    - Start this with `yarn mock-api`
    - This will spin up the mock API at http://localhost:3001 
    
2. Frontend, which displays and filters data.
    - Start this in development mode with `yarn watch`
    - Go to http://localhost:3000

Start both to run the project!
